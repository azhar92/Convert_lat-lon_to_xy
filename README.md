# convert_lat-lon_to_xy
[GNSS/INS unit] Convert Latitude and Longitude to xy scale 

This code helps to create to convert lat, lon coordinates on a XY plane.

The data comes from OXTS GNSS/INS unit, RT3003 in csv format. 

Purpose: Used for getting very accurate positioning of a vehicle. Using the vehicle's position on a pre-defined ground truth(lane markings), we can get the relative positioning of the vehicle to the lane markings.

This will be very useful for assessment of the vehicle's safety behaviour.
